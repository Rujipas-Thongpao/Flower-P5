# Flower Generator in P5.js
This is my very first creative art using [p5](https://p5js.org/)

I follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTqvf0BkTNE&list=PLyRZnpOSgMj3K8AV2I6UldnvTj6d_Zrf0) youtube playlist which is very incredible tutorial for people who start learning p5js

for color scheme I use [rose-pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/)
